      <p><strong>Slum Needs Basic Support</strong></p>

      <p>
        Matisi is a slum on the west side of Kitale, Kenya. Originally people would
        leave their villages thinking they'd find work in Kitale and settle in temporary
        makeshift housing on the outskirts of town. Now, after several generations in
        the slum, many people have lost their village roots and live without running
        water and with dispersed pit latrines.
      </p>

      <p>
        We sponsor a weekly food basket program for over a hundred of these neediest
        families, often elderly grandmothers who care for their HIV-orphaned
        grandchildren. We feel that care for orphans is best done by extended families.
        To achieve that, we provide food supplementation of porridge, maize, and beans
        each week while monitoring weight gain/loss to assure that we're doing well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our medical assistance program has provided transportation and medicine for
        thousands of people in Matisi. Most people walk wherever they go, but the new
        hospital is four miles away. We provide motorbike transport for patients when
        their condition requires a hospital visit rather than being seen at a local
        clinic.
