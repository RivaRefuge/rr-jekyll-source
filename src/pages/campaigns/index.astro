      <p>
        Riva Refuge is a small, secular non-profit organization that helps children,
        youth, young women, disabled, and elderly. Presently, we have three projects
        that need assistance:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="/campaigns/jadelle-family-planning-program/">Jadelle contraception program</a></li>
        <li><a href="/campaigns/scholarship-program/">Scholarships for disadvantaged children/youth</a></li>
        <li><a href="/campaigns/matisi-food-medicine/">Matisi Food and Medicine</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our mission is to elevate the well-being of disadvantaged people, empowering
        them to succeed. We work in several countries in Africa and sometimes in
        Central America, the Caribbean and the United States. We are a volunteer only
        organization with no paid staff.
