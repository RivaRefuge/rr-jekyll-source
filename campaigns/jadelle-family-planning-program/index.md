*In a slum in Kenya, we are bringing choices to poor women.*
Sometimes it’s hard to know what to do to help a neighborhood when it is rife
with unemployment, backyard brewing, child neglect, hunger and alcoholism. The
best thing we can do now is to offer family planning options for women who
cannot afford it. Since March 2014 we have provided Jadelle®, a five-year
reversible contraceptive implant at no cost to women. Our hope is to delay a
woman’s first pregnancy (allowing her to finish school) and increase the space
between subsequent births, which is healthier for both mother and babies. In
the first year of this program we have provided over implants to over 4,000
women.
