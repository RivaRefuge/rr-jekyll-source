**Slum Needs Basic Support**

We sponsor a weekly food basket program for over a hundred of the neediest
families, typically elderly grandmothers who care for their HIV-orphaned
grandchildren. We feel that care for orphans is best done by extended families.
To achieve that, we provide food supplementation of porridge, rice, cooking oil,
and other basics.

Our medical contingency program has provided medicine and surgery for over 600
people in Matisi in 2014. Lastly, weâ€™ve provide monthly sanitary supplies to
500 teen girls so that they can attend school all month long.
