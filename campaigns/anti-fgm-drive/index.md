Female Genital Mutilation is still strongly practiced in the Mara Region of
Tanzania especially in Tarime District where people belong to the Kurya tribe
and FGM is deeply rooted in their culture. So began the request that Riva Refuge
fund food and sanitary supplies for the girls attending a five-week resident
camp during the tribal "cutting season". In 2014 we provided for the 634 young
women who attended this cultural alternative to cutting. Prior to that we have
helped more than 1,000!
