**At-Risk Scholars Get a Hand-Up** We sponsor the neediest of students, usually
in Kenya, and typically orphans. Sometimes we will sponsor a student who still
has one parent if that parent has a disability. We provide scholarships for high
 school, university, polytechnic (trade) school, and rehabilitation schools.
 While elementary school is tuition free, we assist with uniforms, books, and
 shoes as well as various school fees. We like to protect the privacy of our
 students on scholarship but these are some recent recipients:
 
 A high school
 student’s parents both died before he was 2 yrs old. He spent over a decade in
 an orphanage until he was ejected upon finishing the 8th grade because "funds
 were tight and the home was overflowing." He’s been living with Good Samaritans
 since then, and Riva Refuge has been paying for his school expenses. We hope to
  increase his scholarship so that he can attend a boarding high school with a
  rigorous science curriculum for the next two years to help him meet his dream
  of becoming an engineer.
  
  A freshman was about to begin high school when her father was injured and
  unable to work for months. We sponsored her until he was able to get back on
  the job to pay her expenses herself. Without the scholarship, she’s have had
  to sit out the full year.
  
  Another of our scholarship/grant recipients had been a young elementary
  teacher before a catastrophic illness left her blind. We provided a Braille
  machine, a laptop with screen reading software, and many supplies to assist
  her rehabilitation. She now runs a nonprofit organization in Tanzania where
  she assists others with Community Based Rehabilitation.
